Autonomous Model Railroad Switching

What is the name of your proposed project?\
Autonomous Model Railroad Switching

In one or two sentences, briefly explain the need being fulfilled by your proposed project.\
The cars that form a train are gathered and separated and major rail junctions. This allows trains to route cars efficiently. This process of separating cars and collectingcars is called switching. This operation is currently done under human control. This project will establish the infrastructure for an automated solution.

In a few sentences or less, summarize your approach for addressing the need above.\
Modern model trains have onboard controllers that respond to commands sent throughthe track. A train position system will be implemented and integrated with the Digital Command Control, DCC, protocol to precisely position trains during the switchingoperation.

Describe the ultimate end-user(s) of your proposed project system. (Who will use it?)\
This system is a fun way to implement autonomous systems using legacy human-in-the-loop equipment and processes. Applications to manufacturing, transportation, and construction abound.

If the project is sponsored by an external entity, please describe the sponsor and the type support that it will provide.\
